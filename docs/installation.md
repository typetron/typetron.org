### Requirements

Before you start using Typetron, make sure you have [Node.js >12.14](https://nodejs.org) installed.

### Installation

Typetron provides a CLI(Command Line Interface) for scaffolding new projects. You get install the Typetron CLI with
npm:
```sh
$ npm install -g typetron
```

Once you installed the Typetron CLI you can use the `new` command to create a new project:
```bash
$ typetron new MyProject
```

In order to start running your project, go inside it and run the following command:
```bash
$ npm start
```
 
This will create a development server on you machine that automatically reloads the app when you make code changes.
You can open your app at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
