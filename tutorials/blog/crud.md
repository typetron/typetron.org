## Creating, updating and deleting

After we created the _Article_ entity and showed all the articles, we can now go and create the methods/actions that
will take care of handling the other user's requests.

#### Showing one article

Let's imagine a user will click on an article (since we don't have a frontend yet). In this case, our app should display
the contents of that article. Let's add a method inside _HomeController_ again, that will display one particular
article:

```file-path
üìÅ Controllers/Http/HomeController.ts
```

```ts
import { Controller, Get } from '@Typetron/Router'
import { Article } from 'App/Entities/Article'

@Controller()
export class HomeController {

    @Get()
    index() {
        return Article.get()
    }

    @Get(':id')
    read(id: number) {
        return Article.find(id)
    }

    @Post()
    add(form: ArticleForm) {
        return form
    }
}
```

By giving the _@Get_ decorator the parameter _:id_, Typetron will register a method that will handle all the requests
to _/1_,_/2_,_/3_ etc., where those numbers represent our article identifier.

Now, if you go to [localhost:8000/1](http://localhost:8000/1) you will see all the contents of a the article with
_id_ 1. If you change that 1 into 2, you will see the contents of article 2 and so on.

We can also use [Route-Entity](/docs/controllers#route-entity-binfing) binding, which is just a fancy name, where
Typetron will find the Entity for you based on the name of the route parameter and the name of the entity:

```file-path
üìÅ Controllers/Http/HomeController.ts
```

```ts
import { Controller, Get, Post } from '@Typetron/Router'
import { Article } from 'App/Entities/Article'

@Controller()
export class HomeController {

    @Get()
    index() {
        return Article.get()
    }

    @Post()
    add(form: ArticleForm) {
        return form
    }

    @Get(':Article')
    read(article: Article) {
        return article
    }
}
```

Passing _article_ as a route parameter and _Article_ as a method argument, Typetron will do _Article.find()_ for you.

#### Creating an article

Our app can display all the articles or one particular article. Let's make it more interesting and add the ability to
create an article. To do that, replace the _add_ method inside _HomeController_ with this piece of code:

```file-path
üìÅ Controllers/Http/HomeController.ts
```

```ts
import { Controller, Get, Post } from '@Typetron/Router'
import { Article } from 'App/Entities/Article'

@Controller()
export class HomeController {

    @Get()
    index() {
        return Article.get()
    }

    @Get(':Article')
    read(article: Article) {
        return article
    }

    @Post()
    async add() {
        const article = new Article()
        article.title = 'My awesome article'
        article.content = 'My awesome content'
        await article.save()
        return article
    }
}
```

We also have a shorter alternative for creating a new entity:

```file-path
üìÅ Controllers/Http/HomeController.ts
```

```ts
import { Controller, Post } from '@Typetron/Router'
import { Article } from 'App/Entities/Article'

@Controller()
export class HomeController {

    @Get()
    index() {
        return Article.get()
    }

    @Get(':Article')
    read(article: Article) {
        return article
    }

    @Post()
    add() {
        return Article.create({
            title: 'My awesome article',
            content: 'My awesome content'
        })
    }
}
```

The _@Post()_ decorator will register a route that will handle all the HTTP POST requests. Since we don't have a
frontend with a form that we can fill, we can't make such requests from our browser, but we can
use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) for that. There, we can change the HTTP Method to POST and write the url we
want to post to, which is _localhost:8000_. If we run this request and check our database we will see we will have a new
article with the title _My awesome article_. Actually, every time we run that request we will create such an article.

Let's make it even more interesting and add the user the ability to add his own title and content. To do so, change the
body of the request into this JSON:

```file-path
üåê [POST] /
```

```json
{
    "title": "Cool article",
    "content": "Cool article content"
}
```

We can now use this that in our controller like so:

```file-path
üìÅ Controllers/Http/HomeController.ts
```

```ts
import { Controller, Get, Post } from '@Typetron/Router'

@Controller()
export class HomeController {

    @Get()
    index() {
        return Article.get()
    }

    @Get(':Article')
    read(article: Article) {
        return article
    }

    @Post()
    add(request: Request) {
        const data = request.body as {title: string, content: string}
        return Article.create({
            title: data.title,
            content: data.content
        })
    }
}
```

We created a form earlier called _ArticleForm_ that can also validate user data, so we can use that instead of the
request object:

```file-path
üìÅ Controllers/Http/HomeController.ts
```

```ts
import { Controller, Get, Post } from '@Typetron/Router'
import { ArticleForm } from 'App/Forms/ArticleForm'

@Controller()
export class HomeController {

    @Get()
    index() {
        return Article.get()
    }

    @Get(':Article')
    read(article: Article) {
        return article
    }

    @Post()
    add(form: ArticleForm) {
        return Article.create(form)
    }
}
```

Typetron will validate the user input for us behind the scenes, and it will throw an error in case of invalid data. If
an error is thrown, the method in the controller will never be called, so we know for sure that our data is valid once
it goes in the controller.

Now, you can use Postman to create a new article:

<p align="center" class="window">
  <img src="/images/tutorials/blog/new-article.png" />
</p> 

#### Updating and deleting articles

We can easily add, update and delete actions to our controller:

```file-path
üìÅ Controllers/Http/HomeController.ts
```

```ts
import { Controller, Delete, Get, Patch, Post } from '@Typetron/Router'
import { ArticleForm } from 'App/Forms/ArticleForm'
import { Article } from 'App/Entities/Article'

@Controller()
export class HomeController {

    @Get()
    index() {
        return Article.get()
    }

    @Get(':Article')
    read(article: Article) {
        return article
    }

    @Post()
    add(form: ArticleForm) {
        return Article.create(form)
    }

    @Patch(':Article')
    update(article: Article, form: ArticleForm) {
        return article.save(form)
    }

    @Delete(':Article')
    async delete(article: Article) {
        await article.delete()
    }
}

```
