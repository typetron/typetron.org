Before showing anything to the user, we need to have some data to show in the first place. Let's create the Tweet
entity. This entity will store all the information about a tweet in the database, like it's _content_ for example.

#### Creating the Tweet entity

Let's think a bit about what fields this entity will have:

- a content which is the actual message of the tweet
- the owner of the tweet which is the person that created the tweet
- a date field that will show us when the tweet was posted

Go inside the _Entities_ directory and create the _Tweet.ts_ file there:

```file-path
üìÅ Entities/Tweet.ts
```
```ts
import {
    Column,
    CreatedAt,
    Entity,
    Options,
    PrimaryColumn,
    Relation,
    BelongsTo
} from '@Typetron/Database'
import { User } from './User'

@Options({
    table: 'tweets'
})
export class Tweet extends Entity {
    @PrimaryColumn()
    id: number

    @Column()
    content: string

    @Relation(() => User, 'tweets')
    user: BelongsTo<User>

    @CreatedAt()
    createdAt: Date
}
```

Saving this file will automatically create the _tweets_ table for you in the sqlite database from inside the project.
You can check this database by opening the _database.sqlite_ file with a SQLite client.

> _**Question**_: Why is the database updated automatically?
>
> _**Answer**_: By default, Typetron has the option of automatically update the database turned on.
> This option can be changed from _config/database.ts_ file. [More info here](/docs/database)

> _**Question**_: What if I want to use a MySQL server?
>
> _**Answer**_: Typetron will support MySQL drivers in the future, but because it is still in heavy development,
> we postponed the MySQL feature before the V1 release. You can find more about the [Roadmap here](https://github.com/typetron/framework)

One thing we also need to do, is to update the _User_ entity to reflect the added relationship.
```file-path
üìÅ Entities/User.ts
```
```ts
import { Column, Options, Relation, HasMany } from '@Typetron/Database'
import { User as Authenticable } from '@Typetron/Framework/Auth'
import { Tweet } from 'App/Entities/Tweet'

@Options({
    table: 'users'
})
export class User extends Authenticable {
    @Column()
    name: string

    @Relation(() => Tweet, 'user')
    tweets: HasMany<Tweet>
}
```

This information is used by Typetron to better understand you app, and it also has some other benefits like accessing a
user's tweets like so:
```ts
const myTweets = await user.tweets.get()
```

You can find more information about [relationships here](/docs/orm).

#### Adding tweets in the database

Let's create a route that we can use to add tweets in the database. We can add this route in a new _TweetController_ 
file in the Controllers directory:

```file-path
üìÅ Controllers/TweetController.ts
```
```ts
import { Controller, Post } from '@Typetron/Router'
import { Tweet } from 'App/Entities/Tweet'
import { Request } from '@Typetron/Web'

@Controller('tweet')
export class TweetController {

    @Post()
    create(request: Request) {
        const data = request.content as {content: string}
        return Tweet.create({
            content: data.content,
            // user:  we need users before proceeding
        })
    }
}
```

As you probably noticed in the Tweet entity, it needs a User to which it belongs to. In our case, this user should the
logged-in user, but we didn't talk about this yet. 

#### Registering and logging-in
Typetron has an authentication system built-in, and we can use that to register and login. You can find thin
functionality in the _Controllers/AuthController.ts_ file. ([More about Authentication](/docs/authentication)).

Having this in mind, we can use the `/register` route to register a user:

```file-path
üåê [POST] /register
```

```json
{
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "myPassword",
    "passwordConfirmation": "myPassword"
}
```

Making this request will create a user in the database.

> _**Question**_: How can I make these requests
>
> _**Answer**_: There are various tools you can use to make HTTP requests to a web app. In the first tutorial we
> recommended you to use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) but you can use any app that can make HTTP requests.

Now, having this user, we can log-in into our app:

```file-path
üåê [POST] /login
```

```json
{
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "myPassword"
}
```

After making this request (with the credentials of your choice), you will get a response containing
a [JWT](https://jwt.io/) token similar to this:

```json
{
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzd<...super long string...>"
}
```

We can use this token in our request for endpoints that need an authenticated user, like the _TweetController.create_
route from earlier. If you are sending a request with a valid authentication token, you can then get the authenticated
user like in the updated example below:

```file-path
üìÅ Controllers/TweetController.ts
```
```ts
import { Controller, Middleware, Post } from '@Typetron/Router'
import { Tweet } from 'App/Entities/Tweet'
import { User } from 'App/Entities/User'
import { AuthMiddleware } from '@Typetron/Framework/Middleware'
import { AuthUser } from '@Typetron/Framework/Auth'
import { Request } from '@Typetron/Web'

@Controller('tweet')
@Middleware(AuthMiddleware)
export class TweetController {

    @AuthUser()
    user: User

    @Post()
    create(request: Request) {
        const data = request.content as {content: string}
        return Tweet.create({
            content: data.content,
            user: this.user
        })
    }
}
```

You probably noticed that we used the _@Middleware(AuthMiddleware())_. This is used to protect the routes from being
accessed by users that are not authenticated. Also, it will allow us to use the _@AuthUser_ decorator to get the 
authenticated user.

One other thing that you probably noticed is that we type-hinted the _request.content_ property to _{content: string}_. 
This is done to ensure we will have intellisense in our IDEs. We can continue doing so for every endpoint we create, but
there is a way of getting rid of this that will bring more feature to the table: Forms.

#### Adding the tweet form
Forms are just classes that show what is the shape of our request. This becomes in handy when we want to add request
validations. Let's add a form for our endpoint that creates a tweet:

```file-path
üìÅ Forms/TweetForm.ts
```
```ts
import { Field, Form, Rules } from '@Typetron/Forms'
import { Required } from '@Typetron/Validation'
import { File } from '@Typetron/Storage'

export class TweetForm extends Form {
    @Field()
    @Rules(Required)
    content: string
}
```

We can now use this form in our endpoints inside _TweetController_:

That's it. The shape of our request that creates a tweet has only the _content_ property of type _string_ that is required.
Now we can use this in our endpoint:


```file-path
üìÅ Controllers/TweetController.ts
```
```ts
import { Controller, Middleware, Post } from '@Typetron/Router'
import { Tweet } from 'App/Entities/Tweet'
import { TweetForm } from 'App/Forms/TweetForm'
import { User } from 'App/Entities/User'
import { AuthMiddleware } from '@Typetron/Framework/Middleware'
import { AuthUser } from '@Typetron/Framework/Auth'

@Controller('tweet')
@Middleware(AuthMiddleware)
export class TweetController {

    @AuthUser()
    user: User

    @Post()
    create(form: TweetForm) {
        return Tweet.create({
            content: form.content,
            user: this.user
        })
    }
}
```

## Showing tweets
The last thing we need to do, is to show a list of tweets to the user. Let's add this in our _HomeController_ and not
in _TweetController_ because we want to see the tweets from our root endpoint like _http://localhost:8000/_. This
is just a personal preference. You can safely add the same endpoint in the _TweetController_, and it will work exactly
the same. Keep in mind that _TweetController_ has a prefix, so you would have to use the _http://localhost:8000/tweet_ 
endpoint.


```file-path
üìÅ Controllers/HomeController.ts
```
```ts
import { Controller, Get, Middleware } from '@Typetron/Router'
import { Tweet } from 'App/Entities/Tweet'
import { AuthMiddleware } from '@Typetron/Framework/Middleware'

@Controller()
@Middleware(AuthMiddleware)
export class HomeController {

    @Get()
    async tweets() {
        return Tweet.with('user').orderBy('createdAt', 'DESC').get()
    }
}
```

The _.with('user')_ method will eager-load the 'user' relationship for every tweet. This will solve the n+1 problem
when playing with databases. Find more about eager-loading in [database documentation](/docs/database)
