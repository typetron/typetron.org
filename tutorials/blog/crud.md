## Creating, updating and deleting

After we created the _Article_ entity and showed all the articles, we can now go and create the methods/actions that 
will take care of handling the other user's requests. 

#### Showing one article

Let's imagine a user will click on an article (since we don't have a frontend yet). In this case, our app
should display the contents of that article. Let's add a method inside _HomeController_ again, that will 
display one particular article:
   
```file-path
üìÅ Controllers/Http/HomeController.ts
```
```ts
@Controller()
export class HomeController {

    @Get()
    index() {
        return Article.get()
    }

    @Get(':id')
    read(id: number) {
        return Article.find(id)
    }
}
```

By giving the _@Get_ decorator the parameter _:id_, Typetron will register a method that will handle all the
requests to _/1_,_/2_,_/3_ etc., where those numbers represent our article identifier.

Now, if you go to [localhost:8000/1](http://localhost:8000/1) you will see all the contents of a the article with 
_id_ 1. If you change that 1 into 2, you will see the contents of article 2 and so on.

We can also use [Route-Entity](/docs/controllers#route-entity-binfing) binding, which is just a fancy name, where Typetron will find the Entity for you based 
on the name of the route parameter and the name of the entity:

```file-path
üìÅ Controllers/Http/HomeController.ts
```
```ts
import { Controller, Get, Post } from '@Typetron/Router'
import { Article } from 'App/Entities/Article'

@Controller()
export class HomeController {

    // ...

    @Get(':Article')
    read(article: Article) {
        return article
    }
}
```

Passing _article_ as a route parameter and _Article_ as a method argument, Typetron will do _Article.find()_ for you. 

#### Creating an article

Our app can display all the articles or one particular article. Let's make it more interesting and add the 
ability to create an article. To do that, replace the _add_ method inside _HomeController_ with this piece of code:

```file-path
üìÅ Controllers/Http/HomeController.ts
```
```ts
import { Controller, Get, Post } from '@Typetron/Router'
import { Article } from 'App/Entities/Article'

@Controller()
export class HomeController {

    // ...

    @Post()
    async add() {
        const article = new Article()
        article.title = 'My awesome article'
        article.content = 'My awesome content'
        await article.save()
        return article
    }
}
```

The _@Post()_ decorator will register a route that will handle all the HTTP POST requests.
Since we don't have a frontend with a form that we can fill, we can't make such requests from our browser, but we can 
use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) for that. There, we can change the HTTP Method to POST and write the url 
we want to post to, which is _localhost:8000_. If we run this request and check our database we will see we 
will have a new article with the title _My awesome article_. Actually, every time we run that request we will create
such article. 

Let's make it even more interesting and add the user the ability to add his own title and content. To do so,
change the body of the request into this JSON:
```json
{
    "title": "Cool article",
    "content": "Cool article content"
}
```

To make Typetron take this JSON we should use the form we created earlier. Forms make it easy to organise and validate
the data coming from users. Having this, we can use this form in our controller. Replace the current _add_ method with
this one:

```file-path
üìÅ Controllers/Http/HomeController.ts
```
```ts
import { Controller, Get, Post } from '@Typetron/Router'
import { ArticleForm } from 'App/Forms/ArticleForm'

@Controller()
export class HomeController {

    // ...

    @Post()
    add(form: ArticleForm) {
        return Article.create(form)
    }
}
```
Now, you can use Postman to create a new article:

<p align="center" class="window">
  <img src="/images/tutorials/blog/new-article.jpg" />
</p> 

#### Updating and deleting articles

We can easily add, update and delete actions to our controller:

```file-path
üìÅ Controllers/Http/HomeController.ts
```
```ts
import { Controller, Delete, Get, Patch, Post } from '@Typetron/Router'
import { ArticleForm } from 'App/Forms/ArticleForm'
import { Article } from 'App/Entities/Article'

@Controller()
export class HomeController {

    @Get()
    index() {
        return Article.get()
    }

    @Get(':Article')
    read(article: Article) {
        return article
    }

    @Post()
    add(form: ArticleForm) {
        return Article.create(form)
    }

    @Patch(':Article')
    update(article: Article, form: ArticleForm) {
        return article.save(form)
    }

    @Delete(':Article')
    async delete(article: Article) {
        await article.delete()
    }
}

```
