## Introduction

Typetron is a modern Node.js framework, written in [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), that allows you to
build fully-featured web applications and APIs. Most of the core packages it uses were built from scratch, in Typescript
to preserve the performance of the framework.

### Features

Typetron aims to have all the features necessary for building any web app possible, so you don't need to search for a
third-party package to add in your project. Almost everything you need is available already in Typetron. Most of the
features it has were written from scratch and are available in the framework out of the box. This was done to ensure
that all the features you are using benefit from the latest language and platform features. Also, every package can be
tuned for performance or updated in no time if needed, by the community.

These are some features _Typetron_ aims to have:

* [x] Routing
* [x] Controllers
* [x] Middleware
* [x] Query builder
* [x] ORM (Active Record)
* [x] IoC container
* [x] Services
* [x] ServiceProviders
* [x] Persistence (SQL, NoSQL)
* [x] Intuitive directory structure
* [x] Models (aka smart DTOs)
* [x] Forms & Validations
* [x] Utilities/helper functions
* [x] Easy debugging
* [x] Testing
* [x] Authentication
* [x] Error handling
* [X] CLI

### Roadmap

Typetron is still in development, and a roadmap isn't yet available. You can join the [newsletter](/) to get the latest
updates.


### Performance

Being built with packages created from scratch using the latest features of Typescript, Typetron comes with great 
performance out of the box, compared to other available "batteries-included" frameworks.

### Developer experience

Typetron's source code is built around developer's expectations: it is modern, clean and beautiful. Also, the tools
Typetron is providing are everything a developer needs to build his next awesome project.

### Code sharing

A few years ago we wrote websites. Nowadays we write web applications. The web evolved along with the tools we are
using. A typical web application is composed of at least two parts: a backend app and a frontend app. This separation
led to two different camps that have a very distinct line between them. Typetron aims to give developers tools, so they
can make the backend and frontend apps communicate seamlessly.

### Typescript

Javascript is the language of the web, but Javascript alone is not very powerful. When working on enterprise level apps,
it will slow down the development making the project feel tedious to work with. Typescript provides static typing giving
you and IDEs a richer environment alongside spotting common errors without running the code.

Typetron was build in Typescript's _strict mode_ which enforces you to write a more robust code base making your app
free of bugs.
